# Anime-Database-With-Recommender-System
This project was done for my DBMS class in college. This is an anime database command line app which has an anime recommender system as well.

It is written in Python and uses SQLite for database. It uses user to user collaborative filtering and pearson correlation coefficient for anime recommendations.

REQUIREMENTS :-
Python 3

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT :-
1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure the 'out.csv' and 'animedatabase.db' files are in the same directory as the 'animedbapp.py' file.
3. Open the animedbapp.py file and make the necessary changes which are mentioned in the comments of the file. You need to add your gmail address and password wherever specified to connect to Google's SMTP services to send mails through the app.
4. Run the python file. If using terminal, run the command "python animedbapp.py".
